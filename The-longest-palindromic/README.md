Write a function that finds the longest palindromic substring of a given string. Try to be as efficient as possible!

If you find more than one substring, you should return the one that’s closer to the beginning.

<b>Input:</b> A text as a string.

<b>Output:</b> The longest palindromic substring.

<b>Examples:</b>
```
longest_palindromic('abc') == 'a'
longest_palindromic('abacada') == 'aba'
```
<b>Precondition:</b> 1 < |text| ≤ 20
The text contains only ASCII characters.
